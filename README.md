<b>Clipboard Manager</b>
<b>Last version:</b>
<b>Last update:</b>
Due to the specifics of my work I need to remember dozens of passwords, IP addresses, URLs. Hundreds of people ask me the same questions over and over again. If I will type this all by hand, I will soon lose my mind, so I decided to create my own application that will give me additional clipboard buffers. Of course you can store all your data in a text file, but it takes so much more time: to open file, select what you need to copy, copy it, paste it, close file. Instead, you can just press 1 hotkey to paste needed text. Text files also unencrypted and a good target for stealers and other viruses, plus this information can be accessed by someone who have access to your computer, which is also not good.
